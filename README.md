## About This Site

I came across [Dillion Verma's portfolio template](https://github.com/dillionverma/portfolio) and liked how clean and minimal it was. I decided to tailor it with inspiration from [Magic Portfolio's](https://demo.magic-portfolio.com) aesthetic.

I also got inspired by [ladvace's bento portfolio](https://sparkly-speculoos-0c9197.netlify.app) - the travel section has a 3D globe, which gave the idea to make it interactive and include it in mine!
